Although many watershed studies have suggested depletion of available calcium (Ca) pools, interpretation of ecosystem Ca mass balance has been limited by the difficulty in obtaining mineral weathering flux estimates. While many studies have suggested that weathering flux is insufficient to maintain available soil pools, measurements of concomitant changes in available soil pools are rare. Here, we critically examined application of the Ca:Na ratio method in interpreting the long-term Ca budget of six northern hardwood watershed ecosystems at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Woodstock, New Hampshire, USA. Storage of sodium (Na) in biomass and secondary minerals and on cation exchange sites was low enough so that net ecosystem Na loss was essentially equivalent to mineral weathering flux. Mineral chemistry and mass balance considerations constrained the Ca:Na ratio of weathering products to a sufficiently narrow range that spatial and temporal changes in the ecosystem Ca:Na ratio could be interpreted as changes in contribution of available Ca pools to ecosystem loss. Depletion of available Ca pools was greater in the three experimentally manipulated watersheds with aggrading biomass compared to three reference watersheds with relatively mature forest conditions. Although accelerated loss of Ca in the first few years following disturbance has been documented by prior studies, this study suggests that excess Ca loss continues for at least three decades after treatment, with no evident trend toward the conditions shown in the reference watershed. It is not likely that changes in previously quantified Ca pools account for this sustained loss, suggesting that a previously unstudied Ca pool or release mechanism may be important in ecosystem response to disturbance. Possible sources include Ca oxalate, which is known to accumulate in forest soils, but has not been considered in the context of an ecosystem mass balance. Corresponding Editor: R. A. Dahlgren",,,,,

Cation exchange increased the fluoride concentration by 2.7 mg/L when the Na/Ca molar ratio increased from 0.24 to 9.0, while the salt effect led to a ca. 5–10% increase in complex F- in groundwater due to the further dissolution of fluoride-bearing minerals in the aquifers, as suggested by a model calculation. 2) Anthropogenic contamination from pesticide and fertilizer use and industrial waste discharge is also a main source of fluoride in the groundwater. 3) Evaporation and ion effects favor the enrichment of fluoride in groundwater by encouraging the removal of Ca via precipitation. 4) The desorption of fluoride from mineral/organic matter surfaces is enhanced under alkaline conditions and a high HCO3 content in groundwater.",,,,,

The Sr isotopic composition of the dissolved load is also reported. Special attention is paid to the abundances of REE and to their fractionation between the dissolved and suspended phase. The rivers of the Amazon Basin are among the richest in dissolved REE and are similar to the rivers of the Congo system. However a greater range of fractionation between LREE and HREE is reported here. At a global scale the rivers have intermediate patterns between those of the Congo system and those of high pH rivers such as the Indus and Mississippi rivers. Only few elements (Rb, U, Ba, K, Na, Sr and Ca) are mobilized by silicate weathering. These elements are strongly depleted in the suspended phase with respect to upper continental crust. In the dissolved load, these elements are controlled by atmospheric inputs and the weathering of the main lithologies. We propose a model based on mass budget equations, that allow the proportions derived from the different sources to be calculated. As a consequence silicate, carbonate and evaporite weathering rates can be estimated as well as the consumption of CO2 by weathering of each of these lithologies. Physical weathering rates can be estimated by two complementary approaches. On the one hand, the multi-year average of suspended sediments yields can be used to estimate physical denudation. On the other hand, we have developed a steady-state model of erosion that allows us to calculate physical erosion rates on the basis of the dissolved load of rivers. A mean crustal composition is assumed in this model for the rock sources of the drainage basins. Comparison of the rates predicted by the model to the observed rates shows good agreement for the lowland rivers, but a strong discrepancy for the rivers derived from the Andes. Andean rivers (Solimoes, Madeira and Amazon) have observed sediment yields much greater than those predicted according to the steady-state model of chemical and physical weathering. Two interpretations can account for this inconsistency. The first is that these rivers are not in steady state and hence that the soils are being destroyed. The second requires that the local continental crust is different from the average continental crust of Taylor and McLennan, and contains a large proportion of sedimentary rocks. Using the measured sediment yields, and assuming a steady state, we can estimate the amount of sediment recycling for each drainage basin. For the Amazon at Santarem, we find that at least 25% of the mass of the upper continental crust of the Amazon drainage basin is constituted of recycled material.",,,,,

The most important factor controlling silica in ground water is the rock type in con- tact with the water. Salinity, ph, and relative percentage of various ions do not normally have a measurable influence on natural silica concentrations. Biological activity removes silicafrom some streams, particularly those passing through lakes. The total quantity of silica exportedin solution by streams is related directly to the amount of runoff. Ratesof silica removal vary from less than0.01 mg/cm'/yr in deserts to more than 2.0 mg/cm*/r inhumid mountainous regions.

In this steep and well-drained catchment impacted by typhoon events, the river carries a high dissolved load (average of 320mg/L) dominated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ (73Eq% and 21Eq% of the cationic charge), and SO42− and HCO3− (48Eq% and 51Eq% of the anionic charge). Hysteresis in Ca/Na-discharge data and absence of hysteresis in matching Ca/Sr-discharge data are interpreted as reflecting a mixing of three components. While river chemistry at low- to medium-flow reveals a binary mixing between a rapid surface runoff characterised by the chemistry of first-order tributaries and a component likely to have a deep groundwater chemistry, samples collected at high-flow show the contribution of a third water source not immediately mobile and therefore called slow surface runoff. The relative contribution of these end-members has been estimated through hydrograph separations, and then validated by modelling of the observed riverine 87Sr/86Sr variations (0.0013) during a typhoon. The 37-yr average estimates that 16±3% of the river discharge comes from the deep groundwater reservoir while slow and rapid surface runoff provide 21±5% and 63±5%, respectively. The slow surface runoff is the least well characterised of the end-members but the modelled evolution of water chemistry along its flow-path suggests that cations (except Na) and sulphate are removed from the water in the slow surface runoff source region by the combination of biological uptake, bacterial reduction and pedogenesis (clays and carbonate precipitation) — processes that might be partly driven by the evapo-transpiration that removes 75% of the water within this reservoir. The silicate cation denudation rate for the Liwu is 18tkm−2yr−1, which is one of highest measured so far in the world for felsic lithologies. This high value has to be modulated by the facts that 1) deep chemical weathering of silicate accounts for more than 1/3 of this flux, and 2) sulphuric-acid weathering is significant in this catchment. In Taiwan, the input of chemicals in river flux from deep reservoirs is likely to be promoted by rapid uplift of fractured rocks, but the underlying processes (chemical reaction in a porous media) responsible for such significant groundwater contribution are also present in alluvial and sedimentary basins.",,,,,

With climate and vegetation held constant, we compared soil mineralogy and major element chemistry of soil waters from a carbonate-free temperate aspen forest site in the Cheboygan watershed, northern Michigan, with that from carbonate-containing soils from experimental tree-growth chambers (low- vs. high- fertility). All soils were well-drained sands (quartz, Na-rich plagioclase, and K-feldspar) with minor amounts of carbonate present only in the experimentally manipulated soils. The Na+ concentrations in soil waters corrected for atmospheric deposition (Na*) were used to compare relative rates of plagioclase feldspar weathering across sites. In natural soil water profiles, maximum concentrations of Na*, Si, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were observed by a depth of 15 cm, a soil zone free of carbonate minerals. Mean Na* and DOC concentrations were different in the three soils, and increased in the order natural soil < low-fertility chambers < high-fertility chambers. While low pH environments are generally viewed as enhancing weathering rates, here higher Na* appears to be related to high DOC, which is consistent with observed increases in active organic functional groups as pH increases. Our results suggest that under a specific vegetative cover, the soil carbon environment affects the weathering flux observed. Our study also suggests that disturbed soils provide an enhanced physical and chemical environment for weathering. Generalized silicate weathering models may benefit from including the enhancing effects of organic anions at moderate pH in addition to precipitation and temperature.",,,,,

In this paper, newly compiled data on the 60 largest rivers of the world are used to calculate the contribution of main lithologies, rain and atmosphere to river dissolved loads. Technically, an inverse method is used to solve a model containing of a series of mass budget equations relating river concentrations to chemical weathering products and atmospheric inputs. New estimates of global silicate weathering fluxes and associated CO2 consumption fluxes are given. The role of basalt weathering on oceanic islands and volcanic arcs is emphasized. For each large river, an attempt is made to calculate chemical weathering rates of silicates per unit area. Only relative chemical weathering rates can be calculated. The relationships between the chemical weathering rates of silicates and the possible controlling parameters are explored. A combined effect of runoff-temperature and physical denudation seems to explain the variability of modern silicate chemical weathering rates. The results of this study highlight the coupling between the physical and the chemical processes of silicate weathering. Only an active physical denudation of continental rocks seems to be able to maintain high chemical weathering rates and significant CO2 consumption rates.",,,,,

By accumulating in terrestrial plants to a similar extent as some major macronutrients (0.1–10% Si dry weight), Si becomes largely mobile in the soil-plant system. Litter-fall leads to a substantial reactive biogenic silica pool in soil, which contributes to the release of dissolved Si (DSi) in soil solution. Understanding the biogeochemical cycle of silicon in surface environments and the DSi export from soils into rivers is crucial given that the marine primary bio-productivity depends on the availability of H4SiO4 for phytoplankton that requires Si. Continental ﬂuxes of DSi seem to be deeply inﬂuenced by climate (temperature and runoff) as well as soil-vegetation systems. Therefore, continental areas can be characterized by various abilities to transfer DSi from soil-plant systems towards rivers. Here we pay special attention to those processes taking place in soil-plant systems and controlling the Si transfer towards rivers. We aim at identifying relevant geochemical tracers of Si pathways within the soil-plant system to obtain a better understanding of the origin of DSi exported towards rivers. In this review, we compare different soilplant systems (weathering-unlimited and weathering-limited environments) and the variations of the geochemical tracers (Ge/Si ratios and δ30Si) in DSi outputs. We recommend the use of biogeochemical tracers in combination with Si massbalances and detailed physico-chemical characterization of soil-plant systems to allow better insight in the sources and fate of Si in these biogeochemical systems.",,,,,

Increased DSi retention within the fluvial system due to damming and eutrophication has led to a decrease in DSi exports to coastal waters, which can have severe consequences for coastal areas where ecosystem functioning depends on fluvial DSi inputs. The analysis of fluvial DSi fluxes and DSi retention at regional to global scales is thus an important research topic. This study explores the possibility to empirically assess regional DSi retention based on a spatially explicit estimation of DSi mobilization and fluvial DSi fluxes calculated from hydrochemical monitoring data. The uncertainty of DSi retention rates (rDSi) estimated for particular rivers is high. Nevertheless, for the St. Lawrence River (rDSi = 91 %) and the Mississippi River (rDSi = 13 %) the estimated DSi retention rates are reasonable and are supported by literature values.

However, uncertainty regarding the processes that regulate the operation of the negative feedback limits our ability to interpret past variations in the ocean–atmosphere carbon cycle. In particular, the mechanisms that determine the flux of weathered material for a given climatic state are still poorly understood. Here, we quantify the processes that determine catchment-scale solute fluxes for two lithologic end-members—basalt and granite—by applying a recently developed solute production model that links weathering fluxes to both discharge and the reactivity of the weathering material. We evaluate the model against long-term monitoring of concentration–discharge relationships from basaltic and granitic catchments to determine the parameters associated with solute production in each catchment. Higher weathering rates in basaltic catchments relative to granitic catchments are driven by differing responses to increases in runoff, with basaltic catchments showing less dilution with increasing runoff. In addition, results from the solute production model suggest that thermodynamic constraints on weathering reactions could explain higher concentrations in basaltic catchments at lower runoff compared to granitic catchments. To understand how the response to changing discharge controls weathering fluxes under different climatic states, we define basalt/granite weatherability as the ratio of the basalt catchment flux to the granite catchment flux. This weatherability is runoff-dependent and increases with increasing runoff. For HCO3− and SiO2(aq) fluxes, for modern global runoff, the derived mean basalt/granite weatherability is 2.2 (1.3–3.7, 2σ) and 1.7 (1.6–2.1, 2σ), respectively. Although we cannot determine the array of individual processes resulting in differences among catchments, the relative differences in certain model parameters that represent catchment-scale weathering fluxes of granitic and basaltic lithologies are robust. Our approach provides a mechanism that links runoff with the distribution of global sub-aerial silicate lithologies to understand how the basalt/granite weatherability of the Earth’s surface may have varied on geologic timescales. The relationships between basalt/granite weatherability and runoff derived in this study could be used to parameterize the silicate weathering negative feedback to model past changes in pCO2.",,,,,

The major factors governing DSi mobilization by chemical weathering on continental or global scales have not been satisfactorily quantified. Furthermore, influence of regional variations of proposed factors on large scale DSi mobilization is not properly assessed. A continental-scale, process-oriented, empirical model for DSi mobilization is developed to assess this research gap. The model is calibrated on river chemistry data from 142 monitoring stations from the conterminous USA, selected for minimal anthropogenic and water–body influence in their catchments. The average area of the catchments is 3890km2. The average observed DSi yield of the catchments is 2.68t SiO2 km−2a−1. The model calculates DSi yield as subject to catchment attributes, i.e. climate, lithology, land cover and morphology. As lithological source data for the model, a new lithological map of North America was developed. The high spatial resolution of the new map allows assessment of lithology classes with mapped extents as small as 0.5km2. The average lithology polygon size is 75km2. The developed multi-lithological, non-linear, lumped model for annual DSi mobilization describes 89% of the observed variance of DSi yield. It uses lithology proportion and runoff as predictors. With runoff, DSi yield increases differently for individual lithological classes. Basic igneous rocks show the highest DSi yields with respect to a given runoff. Consolidated sedimenary lithological classes yield DSi in the reversed order of their defined silicon contents. Of all lithological classes, the least DSi per runoff is mobilized from acid plutonic rocks. Apart from the two major predictors, analysis of the model also provides evidence for an influence of temperature and land cover on DSi mobilization. Comparison with existing studies shows that controlling factors on DSi mobilization vary regionally. Thus, studies calibrated in different regions result in significantly different DSi yields for comparable lithological classes. This emphasizes the need for global DSi mobilization models to be regionally calibrated.",,,,,

The colour may be compared with that of standard solutions of picric acid (Diénert & Wandenbulcke, 1923) or potassium chromate (Swank & Mellon, 1934).

In particular, loops in the c–Q curve, commonly referred to as hysteresis loops, are used to infer particular mixing patterns. At the South Fork of Brokenback Run (SFBR) in the Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, we have evidence that stream dynamics reflect a system composed of an ephemeral subsurface stormflow zone perched above a perennial water table. The relationship between dissolved silica and stream discharge exhibits hysteresis in the clockwise (CW) direction. Modelling this relationship in the context of three-component mixing with constant-concentration end members failed to reproduce the observed c–Q pattern. In this paper we examine the possibility that temporal variation in soil-water concentrations of silica can explain how CW hysteresis loops in the c–Q curve can arise. In particular, we examine the role of the ratio of a hydrological time scale to a chemical time scale in determining the nature of hysteresis loops. The CW loops that we observe in SFBR can be explained by time variability in soil-water concentrations only if the chemical (leaching) time constant is less than (or only slightly greater than) the hydrological time constant. The near equality of these time constants is consistent with reports from hydrological measurements and leaching experiments. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,

Concentrations in base flow, taken to be a reflection of groundwater, vary with discharge, an observation in conflict with the typical assumption of constant concentration used in end-member mixing analyses. This observed flow dependence was modeled by considering the concentration in groundwater to be related to the saturation deficit in this zone. A positive correlation between the average groundwater saturation deficit and base flow dissolved silica concentrations is consistent with batch experiments and petrographic analysis of regolith core samples, which both indicate an increase in silica available for dissolution with depth in the groundwater zone. In the absence of subsurface storm flow zone sampling during rainfall events a constant concentration was assumed for this zone. Concentration-discharge (C-Q) paths in the stream were used to evaluate the modeled stream silica concentrations. An inconsistency in the direction of the modeled C-Q rotations suggests that the storm flow zone dissolved silica concentration may also vary with time, because of the “flushing” of high-concentration, preevent soil water on the rising limb of the storm hydrograph.

Although their paper provides an excellent example of how we should make connections between small- and large-scale hydrology, the analysis still lacked sufficient consideration of the spatial variability of hydrological behaviour at the hillslope/headwater scale. Here, we extend the discussion of Shaman et al. to smaller sized catchments. We use detailed datasets of hydrometric and hydrochemical measurements collected at the hillslope and small catchment scale at the Fudoji and Ibi catchments in Japan. We show that: (1) large spatial variation in the hydrological responses is present at the hillslope scale and that these responses are strongly controlled by the contribution of water flow from the bedrock into the soil at baseflow; (2) the spatial variability of hydrological responses in headwaters is damped compared with that of the hillslope, and this damping is determined by the integration of the hillslope responses which largely occurs in the stream.

The signal of these two end-members is often obscured by biological uptake and/or groundwater input in the river catchment. McMurdo Dry Valleys streams in Antarctica have no deep groundwater input, no connectivity between streams and no surface vegetation cover, and thus provide a simplified system for us to constrain the supply of dissolved silicon (DSi) to rivers from chemical weathering in a glacial environment. Here we report dissolved Si concentrations, germanium/silicon ratios (Ge/Si) and silicon isotope compositions (δ30SiDSi) in Crescent Stream, McMurdo Dry Valleys for samples collected between December and February in the 2014-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 austral seasons. The δ30SiDSi compositions and DSi concentrations are higher than values reported in wet-based glacial meltwaters, and form a narrow cluster within the range of values reported for permafrost dominated Arctic Rivers. High δ30SiDSi compositions, ranging from + 0.90 ‰ to + 1.39 ‰, are attributed to (i) the precipitation of amorphous silica during freezing of waters in isolated pockets of the hyporheic zone in the winter and the release of Si from unfrozen pockets during meltwater-hyporheic zone exchange in the austral summer, and (ii) additional Si isotope fractionation via long-term Si uptake in clay minerals and seasonal Si uptake into diatoms superimposed on this winter-derived isotope signal. There is no relationship between δ30SiDSi compositions and DSi concentrations with seasonal and daily discharge, showing that stream waters contain DSi that is in equilibrium with the formation of secondary Si minerals in the hyporheic zone. We show that δ30SiDSi compositions can be used as tracers of silicate weathering in the hyporheic zone and possible tracers of freeze-thaw conditions in the hyporheic zone. This is important in the context of the ongoing warming in McMurdo Dry Valleys and the supply of more meltwaters to the hyporheic zone of McMurdo Dry Valley streams.",,,,,

Soil warming stemming from climate change can alter the cycling of elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, in forested ecosystems. However, the effects of soil warming on the biogeochemical cycle of silica in forested ecosystems remains unexplored. Here we examine long-term forest silica cycling under ambient and warmed conditions over a 15-year period of experimental soil warming at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA). Specifically, we measured silica concentrations in organic and mineral soils, and in the foliage and litter of two dominant species (Acer rubrum and Quercus rubra), in a large (30 x 30 m) heated plot and an adjacent control plot (30 x 30 m). In 2016, we also examined effects of heating on dissolved silica in the soil solution, and conducted a litter decomposition experiment using four tree species (Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra, Betula lenta, Tsuga canadensis) to examine effects of warming on the release of biogenic silica (BSi) from plants to soils. We find that tree foliage maintained constant silica concentrations in the control and warmed plots, which, coupled with productivity enhancements under warming, led to an increase in total plant silica uptake. We also find that warming drove an acceleration in the release of silica from decaying litter in three of the four species we examined, and a substantial increase in the silica dissolved in soil solution. However, we observe no changes in soil BSi stocks with warming. Together, our data indicates that warming increases the magnitude of silica uptake by vegetation and accelerates the internal cycling of silica in in temperate forests, with possible and yet unresolved effects on the delivery of silica from terrestrial to marine systems.",,,,,

Silicon, like potassium, calcium and manganese, is a very good tracer of the functioning of forest ecosystems: deciduous forest ecosystems are characterized by moderate weathering release and geochemical drainage, and by a strong biological cycle (85% of the soluble silicon is derived from the soil biogenic silica). In contrast, coniferous forest ecosystems have a weak biological cycle and a strong silicon weathering release flow (85% of the soluble silicon is derived from the crystalline soil minerals).",,,,,

Here, we consider the mechanisms controlling DSi in forest soil in a temperate granitic ecosystem that would differ from previous works mostly focused on tropical environments. This study aims at tracing the source of DSi in forest floor leachates and in soil solutions under various tree species at homogeneous soil and climate conditions, using stable Si isotopes and Ge/Si ratios. Relative to granitic bedrock, clays minerals were enriched in 28Si and had high Ge/Si ratios, while BSi from phytoliths was also enriched in 28Si, but had a low Ge/Si ratio. Such a contrast is useful to infer the relative contribution of silicate weathering and BSi dissolution in the shallow soil on the release of DSi in forest floor leachate solutions. The δ30Si values in forest floor leachates (−1.38‰ to −2.05‰) are the lightest ever found in natural waters, and Ge/Si ratios are higher in forest floor leachates relative to soil solution. These results suggest dissolution of 28Si and Ge-enriched secondary clay minerals incorporated by bioturbation in organic-rich horizons in combination with an isotopic fractionation releasing preferentially light Si isotopes during this dissolution process. Ge/Si ratios in soil solutions are governed by incongruent weathering of primary minerals and neoformation of secondary clays minerals. Tree species influence Si-isotopic compositions and Ge/Si ratios in forest floor leachates through differing incorporation of minerals in organic horizons by bioturbation and, to a lesser extent, through differing Si recycling.",,,,,

The global biogeochemical Si cycle is of great interest because of its impact on global CO2 concentrations through the combined processes of weathering of silicate minerals and transfer of CO2 from the atmosphere to the lithosphere. A sizable pool of Si is contained as accumulations of amorphous silica, or biogenic silica (BSi), in living tissues of growing plants, known as phytoliths, and, after decomposition of organic material, as remains in the soil. The annual fixation of phytolith silica ranges from 60–200 Tmol yr−1 and rivals that fixed in the oceanic biogeochemical cycle (240 Tmol yr−1). Internal recycling of the phytolith pool is intense with riverine fluxes of dissolved silicate to the oceans buffered by the terrestrial biogeochemical Si cycle, challenging the ability of weathering models to predict rates of weathering and consequently, changes in global climate. Consideration must be given to the influence of the terrestrial BSi pool on variations in the global biogeochemical Si cycle over geologic time and the influence man has had on modifying both the terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles.",,,,,

We report here significant increases in streamwater transport of dissolved silicate (DSi) following experimental forest harvesting at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, USA. The magnitude of the streamwater response varied with the type of disturbance with the highest DSi export fluxes occurring in the manipulations that left the most plant materials on the soil surface and disturbed the soil surface least. No measurable loss of amorphous silica (ASi) was detected from the soil profile; however, ASi was redistributed within the soil profile after forest disturbance. Mass-balance calculations demonstrate that some fraction of the DSi exported must come from dissolution of ASi and export as DSi. Land clearance and the development of agriculture may result in an enhanced flux of DSi coupled with enhanced erosion losses of ASi contained in phytoliths.",,,,,
